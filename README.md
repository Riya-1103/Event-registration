# Event-registration
this helps to register participants to events, manage seat availability and send confirmation.

problem statement:
In educational institutions and corporate organizations, managing events such as workshops, seminars, and cultural activities is often done manually or using fragmented tools like spreadsheets and emails. This leads to several challenges:
-Event managers struggle to keep track of available seats and registrations in real time.
-Participants do not always receive timely confirmation or reminders, resulting in missed events.
-There is no unified system for monitoring registrations, cancellations, and attendance.
-Event organizers lack analytics and reports to evaluate event participation and success.
This cloud-based Event Registration & Ticketing System will allow event managers to create and manage events, participants to register easily, automate confirmations and reminders, track seat availability dynamically, and provide dashboards for real-time insights.
